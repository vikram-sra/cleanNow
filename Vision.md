1. Check the time
2. suggest the next chore to do
3. the chore should also have a priority level
4. keep track of all the chores done
5. be smart enough to suggest the next chore to do based on the previous chores done and how long ago it was done, so I dont repeat the same chore in a short span of time.
suggest open slots between chores to take a break or do something else not related to chores.

7. Let me focus on a chore if I keep delaying it and suggest me to do it now. I dont want to mix others with the focus chore.
